## 📜 **Project Overview**  
The **Blood Bank Management System** is a Java-based application designed to efficiently manage blood donations, ensure eligibility, and facilitate blood type compatibility searches, including regular and emergency contributions. It allows user to add, view, and search for compatible blood donations while ensuring robust validation and eligibility checks. By utilizing the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, this system ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The project addresses **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Good Health and Well-Being**, enhancing healthcare through effective blood management.

Key functionalities include:  
- 📋 Secure donor account creation and login  
- 💉 Adding and managing **Regular** and **Emergency** donations  
- 🔍 Finding **compatible blood donations** based on blood type  
- 📜 Listing donations in a structured format

## 🛠️ **Object-Oriented Programming Principles**  

### **1. Abstraction** 🌐  
- Centralized common attributes and behaviors in the abstract class `BloodDonation`.  
- Simplifies implementation by focusing on key features of the domain.
- Abstract class BloodDonation encapsulates common attributes (e.g., donor name, blood type) and methods.
- Subclasses (RegularDonation, EmergencyDonation) define specific behaviors.

### **2. Inheritance** 🧬  
- Specialized donation types (`RegularDonation` and `EmergencyDonation`) inherit from the `BloodDonation` base class.  
- Promotes **code reuse** and ensures extendability.

### **3. Polymorphism** 🔄  
- Abstract methods like `isEligibleToDonate()` are overridden in subclasses to define type-specific donation rules.  
- Enables the system to handle various donation types seamlessly.

### **4. Encapsulation** 🔐  
- Attributes such as `donorName` and `bloodType` are private and accessed through getter and setter methods.  
- Provides controlled access to critical data, ensuring security and integrity.

### **5. Interface Implementation** 🖇️  
- The `BloodBankOperations` interface defines operations like adding, listing, and finding donations.  
- Ensures modular and consistent system behavior.

## 🌍 **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being**  

This project supports **SDG 3** by:  
- Improving access to life-saving blood donations through structured management.  
- Reducing delays in critical blood supply during emergencies.  
- Ensuring safe donation practices through clear eligibility criteria.
- Facilitates safe and regulated blood donations, reducing risks in transfusions.
- Matches compatible blood donors with recipients swiftly, enhancing medical responses.
- Encourages regular and emergency donations through an organized system.

By connecting donors and recipients efficiently, this system helps address critical healthcare challenges globally. The project contributes to the health and well-being of the community by ensuring efficient blood management, which can save lives in emergencies and improve healthcare accessibility. By automating blood donation and distribution, the system improves the response time during medical emergencies and helps maintain an adequate blood supply. The system is scalable and can be adapted to hospitals or blood banks globally, supporting ongoing health initiatives and improving global healthcare infrastructure.
